# Predict_Blood_Donation_Time_March
The Aim of this project is to generate logistic model  by using a   dataset provided in the UCI Repository. We have used python   language to create logistic regression model (a classification   model) for a Blood Bank dataset. This classification model will   predict probabilities for people donated blood in  "March_2007" We have used confusion matrix to calculated accuracy for this   model and visualized for probabilities distribution. we have also used a visualization method called "Area under the   curve" that helped us to know performace of classification model.
